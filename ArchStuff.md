First check a connection, so 
```shell
ping github.com
```

then 
```
curl -L archfi.sf.net/archfi > archfi
```
for the easy install script. I know that manually doing it is probs the "right way" to do it but tbh I don't really care because archfi is good enough to do install the arch and I don't need to spend 40min partition and mounting disks. The rest is straight foward.
