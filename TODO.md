# OS tests

## Debian 

After using linux for a while I think debian is not very good. I think this because of it's package managment. PPA's are a pain in the ass and snaps are not very trustworthy. Debian systems are very easy to use tho, I think mint and zorin are my faviorate out of all of them 

## Arch 

I love arch because it is very customizable and taught me a lot about my machine. Although I do find myself scared of the AUR, although it contains every peice of software I want, I never really check the pkgs before so I could have installed malware. I also don't like systemd, ik it works and it's roughly the same speed but I feel more comfterable using non systemd systems like openrc and runnit because I think they are more intutive. 

## Gentoo 

The best overall system, helped me learn so much about computers and networks. I don't love portage and it's limitations in terms of things like xmonad being a pain. But overall it makes you get a new appriation for computing. 

## Redhat 

Fedora is probs the best begginer system, it is incredibly stable but I like wm not DE so not my cup on tea. 

## Advice 

For begginers use either 

- Mint 
- Zorin 
- Fedora 
- Garuda 

Then go to 

- Manajaro or flat Arch 

Then go to 
- Gentoo or LFS
