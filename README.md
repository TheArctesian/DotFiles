# ShellSetup

List of os that i don't want to have to set up every time I install or break an xorg.conf

Will need to 

```shell 
chmod +x file.sh
```
Included: 
- Fedora 
- Manjaro/Garuda
- Ubuntu 
- Windows ðŸ¤¢ 
- Mac ðŸ¤¢

I want to say that I dont hate the proprietary OS and am not just a Linux masterace man but windows is so fucking bloated, unless you have a powerful computer can't really run in and powershell is kinda bad so is choco I don't love how many times you need to restart but need it for gaming. Mac is good but it blocks you from doing certain things and I don't love that, I love the fact its built on UNIX and sudo works, I really love brew it works really well, tbh if it supported games and got rid of the hand holding and allowed me to A. Modify hardware B. Make a iso file (ik this exists but its buggy af), I would daily boot mac.
