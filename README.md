## Os I want to try

- Endeavour 
- Kodachi
    - For when I actually decide to pen test
- PopOS
    - Just to see what if it is the linux distro to recommend to friends.
- Elementary 
    - Eh
- Gentoo
    - NEED MORE RAMMMM, or a motherboard that supports enough ram to rebuild os every 10min

## My impressions of OS 
- Fedora
    - Tried the Gnome version and I loved it really liked how easy it was to set up and the gnome workflow was really nice, I didn't love having to use ```dnf``` but overall good experience and I still daily boot it on my laptop, also boxes for running vm's was incredible. 
- Manjaro
    - Was a great introduction to Arch and worked amazingly rare manually config needed, I ran the xfce and i3 version. The I3 version worked great out of the box and was a great intro to the window based linux world 
- Garuda
    - Such a beautiful OS used the plasma one and daily booted it on my workstation for a while and loved it until I was getting some kernel errors but overall great experience 
- Ubuntu
    - Trusted first OS for trying on new machines to understand it. Installed on a surface that I won in a hackathon with 4gb of ram and 50gb of storage I have no clue how they excepted anyone to use it but works amazingly on ubuntu. I do want to give it the arch treatment but idk if the touchscreen will work need to do more research 
- Arch
    - The daily boot main OS, archfi made that process so much easier,
- Artix
    - Only ran this for like a week but I mean it felt like arch but not having systemd kinda felt off to me I will need to give it a proper run later
- Windows ðŸ¤¢ 
    - Great for AAA games and Adobe, and pretty much nothing else. The Bloat is just too much
- Mac ðŸ¤¢
    - Even though it is proprietary it is required for school, it is not ideal but brew is not bad and using it does mess with my workflow but overall not as bad as windows. Just gaming is a problem and as of rn (ik the new M1 are spoused to be amazing) not enough power to do 3d stuff and not enough ram, I would rather ubuntu then mac but mac is not bad and the suite is great. And also good for them for fucking over other bigtech in data privacy although they now might just have a monopoly on data ðŸ¤·
